        Hosting Reborn is an enterprise where people exchange money for services. And strange as it sounds,
        we don't want your money.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course that's not strictly true - without money coming in there would be no Hosting Reborn. So what I mean to
        say is that your money is not what I'm looking to acquire.
    </p>

    <p>
        That still sounds a bit odd, so let's try this: earning money is not the <em>goal</em> but instead a <em>by-product</em>.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <p>
        There's a subtle but important difference between having a goal of <em>earning money</em> and having a goal of
        <em>something else</em> that happens, as a consequence, to earn money.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of earning money goes something like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        We want to make money, so let's create a product and then charge people for the it.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Our goal is more aligned with:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        We want to make a product so useful that people will be pleased to pay money for it.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This is a very important belief at Hosting Reborn. The main focus is always the product, not the money.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the product is not good enough, if the product doesn't make your life easier, if the product
        doesn't disappear into the background and let you get on with what's important to you, if the product
        doesn't fit around your world, then we don't deserve to take your money from you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Seriously, we don't <em>deserve</em> it. The money is your way of showing your respect for the service you
        receive. If you don't feel the service you receive is a fair exchange for the cost, why should we take your
        money?
    </p>

    <p>
        For a service, if money's the goal there's always going to be conflict between the business and the customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a service you subscribe to (satellite/cable TV, ADSL/cable broadband, telephone landline) is unavailable
        for a day or so, do you want a refund? Do you expect to get a refund? Are you entitled to a refund? Will you get a refund?
    </p>

    <p>
        The answers are commonly: yes, perhaps, no and no.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you want a refund? Of course! If I'm paying &pound;20 per month for ADSL broadband and it is unavailable for two days,
        in what way does my provider deserve the full &pound;20? If I get 28/30 days of service in a given month, should I not
        pay &pound;18.67? In what way does the provider deserve &pound;1.33 for two days of non-service?
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you expect a refund? I generally don't, I'm afaid. I think I've been conditioned into thinking this is normal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are you entitled to a refund and will you get a refund? No, you're generally not. Take a look at your terms of service,
        your contracts and your agreements. Your provider will certainly ensure that they're not liable for any interruptions
        to the service they provide.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hardly sounds very fair does it? If something doesn't work out right for you, if something is faulty and doesn't
        provide, within reason, what you expect, you still have to pay whether you like it or not. Hopefully you're too
        tied into the service, or the friction of changing providers is too great, that you'll stick with it whether you
        like it or not.
    </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps you can appreciate now why we don't want your money. We need your money to make Hosting Reborn happen,
        but if in any way it fails you, we can't deserve your money.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we don't help you, if you don't find in Hosting Reborn something great that makes things easier, can we
        consciously take and enjoy your money and pretend we don't care?
    </p>

    <p>
        If something goes wrong, or if any way Hosting Reborn is not right for you, would you want a refund? Would you
        expect a refund? Are you entitled to a refund? Will you get a refund?
    </p>

    <p>
        Yes, to all questions. If we haven't given something of value to you, where you are the only person capable of
        judging the value, in what way could we expect you to give us something of value in return?
    </p>

    <p>
        If you decide to leave Hosting Reborn because it's not right for you, you're always entitled to a full refund
        of every single penny you've paid. We won't ask why, we'll just give you your money back. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Unless, of course, you've done bad things or are simply trying to take advantage of us. After all, that's
        only fair, isn't it?
