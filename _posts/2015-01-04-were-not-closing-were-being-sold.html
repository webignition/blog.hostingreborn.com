        We're no longer <a href="/initial-closing-down-announcement/">closing down</a> and instead are
        selling to a competent and capable company who will continue operating the service.

    <h3>We're not closing down, we're selling</h3>

    <p>
        Following our <a href="/initial-closing-down-announcement/">initial closing down announcement</a>,
        we were contacted by various parties interested in purchasing the business.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had previously considered selling the service as an alternative to closing down, however I wasn't
        certain how easily I could find a buyer who would be capable of operating the service competently
        and in the same spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
        We were recently contacted by <a href="http://www.purple-tiger-media.ltd.uk/">Purple Tiger Media Ltd</a>
        with a proposal to purchase Hosting Reborn.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm convinced that they have the technical capability to continue operating the service smoothly.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're yet to agree on the details of the sale, however I'm certain that the service will be able to
        continue to operate.
