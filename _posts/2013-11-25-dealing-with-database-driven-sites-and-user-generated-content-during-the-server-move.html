    <p>
        I mentioned recently our <a href="/security-concerns-initiate-move-to-new-servers/">plans to move to new hosting servers</a>
        and followed this up with a guide to <a href="/how-to-receive-all-your-email-during-the-server-move/">receiving all your email during the move</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We're now moving hosting accounts to the new hosting servers and in relation
        to this I'd like to outline how you can deal with database-driven sites
        and user generated content during the move.

<div class="section">
    <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
    
    <p>
        Hosting accounts are moving from 178.63.85.207 to 144.76.222.164.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It will take some time for all computers around the world to be aware of this change, sometimes up to 24 hours. This
        is not something we can control.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For a day or so after the move, visitors to your websites may end up reaching either the old hosting server or the 
        new hosting server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you deal with frequent user generated content, such as discussion forums or blog comments, you may find
        content to be inconsistent. If user A reaches the old hosting servers and makes a blog comment and user B
        reaches the new hosting servers and makes a blog comment, each comment will be stored in a different place,
        neither will be visible to all users and over time the comment from user A will be lost.
    </p>      
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Ensuring All Of Your Content Ends Up In The Same Database</h3>
    
    <p>
        For a couple of days after your hosting accounts have been moved, we
        cannot control whether it is the old hosting servers or the new hosting
        servers that are reached by visitors to your websites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It is possible, however, to control into which database such user generated content
        is stored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can change the database configuration for your websites on the old
        hosting servers so as to use the correct database on the new hosting servers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        How you do this depends entirely on the web applications you are running.
        We can't tell you where to make this change, but we can tell you what to change
        and how you can go about doing that.
    </p> 
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Applying Database Configuration Changes On The Old Hosting Servers</h3>
    
    <p>
        Note: this only applies after your hosting accounts have been moved. We will
        send you an email directly once your hosting accounts have been moved.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To apply database configuration changes for a given hosting account:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Establish a FTP connection to 178.63.85.207, using the relevant
                hosting account username and password.
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <p>
                Navigate to your database configuration settings file. What this
                is called and where is located depends entirely on the web application
                you are running. If you're not sure, Google is your friend.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Change the database host from the current setting (most likely 'localhost')
                to 144.76.222.164.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Save and upload your changes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>        
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Verifying That Remote MySQL Connections Are Allowed</h3>
    
    <p>
        The above changes will ensure that your web applications running on the old
        hosting servers will use the relevant database on the new hosting servers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We have configured the MySQL server on the new hosting servers to allow
        remote connections from the old hosting servers.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
        This may not work as expected if you have ever set up additional MySQL
        access hosts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To verify your current MySQL access hosts settings:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Log in to cPanel on the new hosting servers. The cPanel address
                will have changed. Log in to your Hosting Reborn account to
                determine the correct cPanel address.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Navigate to the additional MySQL access hosts section. Refer
                to the <a href="http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/WHMDocs/MySQLHosts">relevant cPanel documentation</a> if you are not sure where this
                is and what it does.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Check that 178.63.85.207 is listed as an allowed host. Add this
                if missing.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
