    <p>
        I mentioned recently our <a href="/security-concerns-initiate-move-to-new-servers/">plans to move to new hosting servers</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I stated in a related email announcement that no mail  will be lost as mail ending up at one of the old servers will be
        routed automatically to the relevant new server. This is still true and
        your email will not get lost.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        Whilst no email will be lost (I've spent the last two days testing
        out various scenarios), you might think some email as gone astray
        as you may be looking in the wrong place for your email when you
        think you're looking in the right place.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here's how you can ensure no interruptions occur to your email service during 
        the move.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Check Your Mail Account Settings Now</h3>
    
    <p>
        If you use Hosting Reborn for your email, both your incoming and 
        outgoing mail servers should be set to either your domain or your mail subdomain.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        For me, that would be either hostingreborn.com or mail.hostingreborn.com.
        For you, replace hostingreborn.com with the domain name in your email address.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you are using any other server name for your incoming or outgoing
        mail server, it is working but conincidence not by design. Unless, of
        course, you're intentionally using another mail service and know
        what you're doing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Check your mail client's server settings now. If either the incoming
        or outgoing mail server address is anything other than the domain
        name in your email address (optionally preceded by <em>mail.</em>) and you're
        not using a third-party mail service, change your settings now.
    </p>

    <h3>Updating Your Mail Server Settings Immediately After The Move</h3>
    
    <p>
        After your own hosting accounts have been moved I will send you an email
        directly detailing what you need to do or look out for.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You may not get that email straight away if you're looking in the wrong
        place for email when you think you're looking in the right place.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here's what you need to look out for when it comes to email to be sure
        that you get the email that we send you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At present, the global DNS system tells your computer to look on the
        current (soon to be old) Hosting Reborn servers when you want to 
        receive new messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Immediately after the move, the global DNS system will know no different.
        Although we will update your DNS records to indicate that your email
        now lives on the new Hosting Reborn servers, it will take some time
        for every Internet service to notice the change.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is how you may end up looking in the wrong place for your email
        when you think you're looking in the right place.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Eventually things will sort themselves out and after a few hours or 
        perhaps a day (it really depends on your Internet provider) but during this
        time you may not be receiving any new emails as all new emails will be
        patiently waiting on the new servers whilst you're looking on the old
        servers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you think you're not receiving new messages immediately after the
        move, you may need to tell your email client to look directly on the
        new Hosting Reborn servers (instead of letting the global DNS system
        figure this out for you).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this respect you've got two options. The first is for advanced
        users, the second is for everyone else:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Set up a local hosts file entry mapping your incoming
                mail server hostname to 144.76.222.164. I am intentionally
                not going to explain that. If that makes no sense it is not
                the option for you.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Make a note of your current incoming mail server address
                and change it to 144.76.222.164. A couple of days later
                you can change it back to what it was. This is likely your
                best option.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>    
    
    <p>
        There is actually a third option: do nothing. Things will sort
        themselves out eventually. Your email will not be lost, just waiting.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting In Touch If You Have Concerns</h3>
    
    <p>
        Please <a href="http://secure.hostingreborn.com/contact/">contact us</a>
        if you have any concerns about your email immediately after your 
        hosting accounts have been moved.
    </p>        
    
    <p>
        If you need to do so, make sure to remember something very important:
        if you are having problems receiving email and you get in touch
        using the very same email address, you may not receive our replies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you do need to get in touch about your email after your hosting
        accounts have been moved, please use an email address not hosted by us
        so that we can be sure you will receive our replies. You can easily
        <a href="//gmail.com/">get a free GMail address</a> which would be fine.
