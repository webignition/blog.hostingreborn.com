        I mentioned recently our <a href="/security-concerns-initiate-move-to-new-servers/">plans to move to new hosting servers</a>.
        Aside from those of you who asked for their accounts to be moved on a specific data, this is now all complete.

    <p>
        If a domain name of yours is used with Hosting Reborn and you don't use
        the Hosting Reborn nameservers, you must update your DNS records.
    </p>

        If you have any A records pointing to 178.63.85.207, these must be
        changed to 144.76.222.164.
