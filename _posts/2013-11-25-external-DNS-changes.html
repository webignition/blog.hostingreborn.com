    <p>
        I mentioned recently our <a href="/security-concerns-initiate-move-to-new-servers/">plans to move to new hosting servers</a>
        and followed this up with a guide to <a href="/how-to-receive-all-your-email-during-the-server-move/">receiving all your email during the move</a>
        and a guide to <a href="/dealing-with-database-driven-sites-and-user-generated-content-during-the-server-move/">dealing with database-driven sites during the move</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We're now moving hosting accounts to the new hosting servers and in relation
        to this I'd like to outline the DNS changes you will need to make if you
        are not using the Hosting Reborn nameservers.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Required DNS Changes</h3>
    
    <p>
        Once your hosting accounts have been moved (you'll be notified via email),
        change any DNS records for 178.63.85.207 to 144.76.222.164.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That's it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you are using the Hosting Reborn nameservers you will not need to 
        make any changes.
    </p>
