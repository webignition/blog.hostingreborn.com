        About 3 months ago we raced into the 21st century by letting you <a href="http://blog.hostingreborn.com/now-live-choose-your-own-password/">choose your own account password</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Following on from this, you can now choose the password for each of your web hosting accounts. Previously you could only reset a hosting account password without any choice of password.

        Either choose your own password:

    <p>
        Or have a strong password automatically chosen for you:
