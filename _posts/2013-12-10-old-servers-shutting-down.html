As of about a week and a half ago, the move of hosting accounts from our old hosting servers to our new hosting servers was completed.

    <p>
Plenty of time has passed for everyone involved to be aware of the move and the changes that are needed. All DNS records under our control point to the new hosting servers and I've done my best to inform everyone who manages their own DNS to make appropriate changes. If you manage your own DNS and haven't yet updated your A records, now would be the time to do it.

The time has come to terminate the old hosting servers. This will occur on Thursday December 12.
