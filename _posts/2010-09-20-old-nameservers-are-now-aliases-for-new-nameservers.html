<div class="section section-first">
    <p>
        Prior to the recent <a href="http://blog.hostingreborn.com/performance-sucks-time-to-upgrade/">server move</a> we were using ns1.webignition.net and ns2.webignition.net as DNS nameservers.
    </p>

    <p>
        We moved to using ns1 to ns4.hostingreborn.com, which required everyone using ns1 and ns2.webignition.net to make changes to their domain names' records.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whilst a bit of a hassle, I thought everyone could cope - after all, if someone can manage to set their domain's nameservers to ns1 and ns2.webignition.net, they'll be able to cope with changing them to ns1 to ns4.hostingreborn.com.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <p>
        Well, some people can't, some people haven't and perhaps some people will forget.
    </p>

    <p>
        So we've now set ns1.webignition.net to be an alias of ns1.hostingreborn.com and ns2.webignition.net to be an alias of ns2.hostingreborn.com.
    </p>

    <p>
        So if you now can't or won't change your domain's nameserver records, you no longer need to.
