        The <a href="http://blog.hostingreborn.com/performance-sucks-time-to-upgrade/">server move</a> announced toward the end of last month is now fully complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        All hosting accounts have been moved, with email and database requests being transferred on from the old servers to the new servers to avoid anything getting lost.
    </p>

    <p>
        We now just need everyone to ensure all domain name records are appropriately updated to prevent websites and email breaking when the old servers are finally decommissioned in about a month from now.

    <h3>Changing nameserver records</h3>

    <p>
        If your domain names' nameserver records are set to ns1.webignition.net and ns2.webignition.net these must be changed to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>ns1.hostingreborn.com</li>
        <li>ns2.hostingreborn.com</li>
        <li>ns3.hostingreborn.com</li>
        <li>ns4.hostingreborn.com</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you manage your own DNS records, you must change occurrences of 78.31.104.54 to 178.63.85.207.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll keep an eye on traffic reaching the old servers and get in touch with anyone who may not have yet made the appropriate changes.
