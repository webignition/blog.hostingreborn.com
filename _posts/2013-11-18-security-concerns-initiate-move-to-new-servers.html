    <p>
        We recently upgraded to the latest verion of cPanel to address
        some potential security concerns. This is a regular preventative measure
        to ensure that the cPanel software is as secure as it currently can be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We subsequently discovered we were unable to upgrade some server software
        due to our systems being a little old. This presents no immediate
        problems but will eventually.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In order to ensure we can continue to apply all necessary security updates,
        we've decided to move to fresh, new hosting servers.

    <h3>Hosting Server Upgrades</h3>
    
    <p>
        As a consequence of moving to new hardware, all of our hosting servers
        will be upgraded to feature:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="contentList">
        <li>
            <strong>Intel® Core™ i7-4770 Quadcore Haswell processors</strong>
            <p class="first">Still the same number of processor cores, but with more processing power.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>32GB DDR3 RAM</strong>
            <p class="first">4 times the amount of RAM, an increase from 8GB per server.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>200 Mbit throughput</strong>
            <p class="first">Twice the current data throughput, up from 100 Mbit.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Upgrade Plan</h3>
    <p>
        We've already provisioned new hosting servers and these are in the
        process of having all the relevant pieces of server software installed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When ready, we'll first move our own hosting accounts over to new
        new servers and check that all is working as expected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We will then be ready to move all user accounts to the new systems. We'll
        post regular updates regarding how this is going and will be in touch
        via email if we have any specific concerns or if there is anything
        specific that you need to do.
    </p>
