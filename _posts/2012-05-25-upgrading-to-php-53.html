    <p>
        We're looking to upgrade all our hosting servers from PHP 5.2.16 to 5.3.13 on Monday July 2 2012.
    </p>

    <p>
        Upgrading to PHP 5.3 allows us to offer a more modern PHP environment and allows us also to offer a more up to date selection of 1-click installs of popular applications and frameworks via Softaculous.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <p>
        Existing PHP applications may break. PHP 5.3 introduces some <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/migration53.incompatible.php" title="PHP 5.2 to 5.3 backward incompatible changes">backward incompatible changes</a>. Any issues are likely to arise from your own code if it has not already been tested under PHP 5.3.
