        We recently upgraded to the latest verion of cPanel to address
        some potential security concerns. This is a regular preventative measure
        to ensure that the cPanel software is as secure as it currently can be.

        You can't currently choose your own password for your Hosting Reborn account. It might sound a bit ridiculous, but we're only looking after your interests.

        Hosting Reborn is an enterprise where people exchange money for services. And strange as it sounds,
        we don't want your money.

        In a typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_hosting" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_hosting">shared hosting</a>
